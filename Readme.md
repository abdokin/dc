# DC Language

DC Language is a versatile, C-inspired compiled programming language enriched with elements of TypeScript. It is designed to be both user-friendly and powerful, offering an excellent platform for writing and executing code.

## Features

### 1. Generate Assembly Based on Program

DC Language is not just a language; it's a learning experience. You can generate assembly code from your DC Language source, providing a unique opportunity to explore the low-level intricacies of your program. This feature is a powerful educational tool for understanding how your code operates under the hood.

### 2. Variable Support

Variables are the lifeblood of any programming language, and DC Language is no exception. You can define and use variables, making it suitable for a wide range of programming tasks. Variables allow you to store and manipulate data within your programs, adding flexibility and richness to your code.

### 3. Function Scoping

DC Language supports function scoping, allowing you to organize your code in a clean and structured manner. Functions enable you to encapsulate and modularize your logic, making your code more maintainable and efficient. 

### 4. Print Function

Debugging and monitoring your program's output is made easy with the built-in `print` function. You can use it to display data on the standard output (stdout), simplifying the process of understanding how your code behaves.

## Example

Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in DC Language:

```dc
fn main(int argc, []int argv) -> int {
    print("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

This program showcases some of DC Language's features, such as the `main` function, variable types, and the `print` function.
